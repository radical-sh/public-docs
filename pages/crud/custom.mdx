# Custom API

Radical.sh generates standard API's of CRUD as soon as the api is enabled. But few custom API's might be required to introduce custom end points. 

Custom API's can be built with following options
1. Go to API tab
2. Click on Add in the sidebar
3. Select the schema for which custom API has to be added
4. Enter the name of API
5. Choose the newly selected API in sidebar


## Visiblity and auth
To control these options, check [modify advanced options](./advanced)

## Request and Response options

### Request Options
In the request side, you can control verb and path of the custom api. 

**Verb** - To contorl whether request is GET / POST / PUT / DELETE

**Path** - This will be path of the custom api. 

Example `/actions/returns`

**Query Parameters** - If any custom query parameters to be added for example `country`

Example `/actions/returns?country=XX`

**Headers** - If any custom header to be consumed in API

### Response Options

Status - Choose between 200 / 201 / 202 

Redirection Url - If 201 / 202 is specified the redirection action has to be selected to a get action on existing resource

### Custom API Type

**Type** - Schema of the custom API, this can be different compared to base schema where custom API is added.


## Example
Create registrations in vechicles

```/vechicles/{vehicleId}/registrations```

1. Vehicle Schema to be created
2. Enable CRUD for vehicles
3. Reigstration Schema to be created
4. Create custom api in vehicles for create registrations
5. Select type as Registration
6. For PUT and POST verb, fields to be exposed can be selected
7. Add query parameters, authorization (optional)
8. Choose the response status

This custom api will add controller and service layer based on visiblity selection.
