# Introduction
 
Welcome to Radical.sh! Radical is a low code tool that generates code (Spring Boot) for API's. You can use it as a starting point for your own project.

## Why Radical?

* Developers often get stuck writing mundane API code.
* The microservices era made it even more time-consuming.
* Radical simplifies and speeds up product prototyping
* It's the ultimate time-saver for developers.

Whether you're crafting new APIs or transforming a monolith into microservices, Radical.sh is your perfect launchpad.

## What can i do with radical.sh

Radical.sh is much more than a skeleton generator, radical captures the domain model in a specification which can be further used to generate layers of code from API's, Events and Repositories.

## Is this a replacement for code completors ? 

No, Radical.sh can generate around 30 - 50% of code base with click of few buttons. This cohesive approach is good enough to start and Chat Gpt / Co Pilot can be leverage on top of the code generated to extend further.
